# Staistical Procedures Tutorials 
## ANOVA family, t-test tutorials for self-study
## MultipLots Tutorial

These R scripts run ten diffrent automated statistical procedures (since you provide the input parameters). 
Please read the comment lines in-between each following procedure code block

PROCEDURES:
1. Checks if R is updated;
2. Loads your dataset;
3. Models your data (check input parameters);
4. Plots from R basics: boxplots, histograms; bar charts; scatter plots; scatter plots and error bars;
5. Checks if ggplot is already installed. If it is not, the scripts installs ggplot package for you;
6. Reports t-test results;
7. Reports ANOVA and LinReg results;
8. Runs an automatic statistical assumption function for T-TEST;
9. Function to identify significant numeric variables based on Kruskall-Walis test
10. Function to identify significant numeric variables based on ANOVA and ANCOVA;
11. Function to identify significant numeric variables based on Mixed Models.
